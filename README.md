# INTRODUCTION 
Pwned Passwords are 517,238,891 real world passwords previously exposed in data breaches. This exposure makes them unsuitable for ongoing use as they're at much greater risk of being used to take over other accounts. They're searchable online below as well as being downloadable for use in other online systems.
The entire set of passwords is downloadable for free  with each password being represented as a SHA-1 hash to protect the original value (some passwords contain personally identifiable information) followed by a count of how many times that password had been seen in the source data.
# HYPOTHESIS 
The security of an account is critical to the successful operation of a system. The following data collection contains passwords along with the number of times they were encountered in common data breaches, making them potentially dangerous. As a result, our project examines the dataset in real time and notifies the user about the password's security.

# FEATURES
Multithreading
Sha-1 encryption
AVL tree searching 
Shows the pwned passwords as well the number of times they have been detected.
It is easily adaptable to any other program. We can use any banking system etc where the user has to choose passwords to sign up.
Data parsing using python.
RESULTS
Time achieved: 24 seconds on average for file reading, 0.000045 seconds average for searching value.
